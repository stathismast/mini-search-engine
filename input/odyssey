A far cry from the arms Odysseus left when he went to Troy, fire-damaged equipment, black with reeking fumes. And a god reminded me of something darker too. When you’re in your cups a quarrel might break out, you’d wound each other, shame your feasting here and cast a pall on your courting. Iron has powers to draw a man to ruin.’ “
